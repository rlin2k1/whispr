whispr
========================
Your medical info is yours. Period.
Whispr is a medical profile app - compile all relevant medical history in one place, with a convenient way to send it to health care providers, and have them add in new information in real-time.

100% online, 100% available, 100% easy service to store and share medical info
● Securely store your data, and access it any time, anywhere
● Plugs into our network, allowing you to easily link with healthcare providers
     ○ Removes the hassle from sharing info across hospitals and insurance companies
     ○ One click:
          ■ Send your info to UCLA Health
          ■ Revoke USC Medicine’s access to it
● From a provider perspective
     ○ Easy access to the healthcare data of users
     ○ Ability to search for and request data from users
     ○ Future goal of aggregated statistics filtered by demographic
 
## Prerequisites

 - Docker 18.09.2

## Getting Started

1. Use `./run build` to build the docker container for postgres, and install packages for the app. 
    - TODO: there's some funkiness here with certain packages here, at least on my machine.
2. Use `./run start` to run the app locally. It will be exposed at http://127.0.0.1:3000.
3. Database migrations on startup must be done with commmand: `bundle exec rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development`
4. For further usage of `./run`, use `./run usage`.

## Testing

-  Tsung Load Testing

## Cleanup

- Press `Ctrl+C` to close a currently-running instance of the docker container.
- Use `./run stop` to stop the docker container running in the background.
- Use `./run tidy` to do a light clean of the docker container.
- Use `./run clean` to do a full cleanup (removes node_modules).
- Use `./run armageddon` for an overly-throrough clean, including removing cached gems.
